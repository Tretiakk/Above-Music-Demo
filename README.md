A production application deployed on Google Play with a lifecycle of approximately two years. This timeline includes 1.5 years of development and 6 months of active maintenance, resulting in 40+ updates. Beyond local playback, the system functions as a cloud-integrated platform with custom user management, synchronization, and an integrated monetization system (AdMob).

Engineered to deliver a superior UX, the application integrates media player features with a custom token economy, authentication, and a personalized news feed. The interface prioritizes fluidity through system-wide animations and a custom onboarding 'training' module, supported by advanced search and sorting algorithms for efficient library management
